## 📚 My Learnings from this Project
### 19/11/2025
Today, I learned and used the onMouseEnter and onMouseLeave attributes.
Even though I already knew about them before, this was my first time actually implementing them in a project.

These attributes helped me:
- Detect when the mouse enters or leaves a specific element
- Trigger smooth hover effects
- Track user interaction on particular components automatically

A small but useful skill added to my React toolkit!
